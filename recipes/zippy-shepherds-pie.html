        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Gather the family round with this quick and easy shepherd's pie recipe. The meat mixture can be made ahead
            and frozen. You can also<br> substitute instant potatoes for the real thing if you're in a hurry. I
            especially love to use white cheddar in this recipe!
        </p>

            <li>2 tablespoons ketchup</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon mild curry powder</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
            <li>2 tomatoes, coarsely chopped</li>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) package frozen mixed peas and carrots</li>
            <li>Â¼ cup milk</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
            <li>1 cup shredded extra-sharp Cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <br>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add potatoes, and cook until tender but still firm,
                about 15 minutes; drain, and return to pan.<br></p></li>
            <li><p>While potatoes are boiling, heat oil in a large skillet. Cook ground beef with onion, red pepper, and
                garlic until beef is evenly brown. Stir in beef broth, ketchup, soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, and
                curry powder. Bring to a boil, and simmer 3 to 4 minutes. Mix cornstarch with a little water to form a
                paste, then stir into skillet with tomatoes, peas and carrots. Cook until thickened; season with salt
                and pepper. Spoon into a casserole dish.<br></p></li>
            <li><p>Preheat oven on broiler setting. Add milk and butter to cooked potatoes, and whip until smooth and
                creamy. Spoon over meat mixture. Sprinkle top with shredded cheese.<br></p></li>
            <li><p>Place under broiler for 3 to 5 minutes, or until cheese is melted and speckled with brown.<br></p></li>

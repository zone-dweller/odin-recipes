            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                Gather the family round with this quick and easy shepherd's pie recipe. The meat mixture can be made
                ahead
                and frozen. You can also<br> substitute instant potatoes for the real thing if you're in a hurry. I
                especially love to use white cheddar in this recipe!
            </p>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add potatoes, and cook until tender but
                        still firm,
                        about 15 minutes; drain, and return to pan.<br></p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>While potatoes are boiling, heat oil in a large skillet. Cook ground beef with onion, red pepper,
                        and
                        garlic until beef is evenly brown. Stir in beef broth, ketchup, soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce,
                        and
                        curry powder. Bring to a boil, and simmer 3 to 4 minutes. Mix cornstarch with a little water to
                        form a
                        paste, then stir into skillet with tomatoes, peas and carrots. Cook until thickened; season with
                        salt
                        and pepper. Spoon into a casserole dish.<br></p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Preheat oven on broiler setting. Add milk and butter to cooked potatoes, and whip until smooth
                        and
                        creamy. Spoon over meat mixture. Sprinkle top with shredded cheese.<br></p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Place under broiler for 3 to 5 minutes, or until cheese is melted and speckled with brown.<br>
                    </p>

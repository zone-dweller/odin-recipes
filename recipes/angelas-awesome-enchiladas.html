        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            The secret to these awesome chicken enchiladas is in the seasonings! I whipped these up on my own using
            ingredients I had on hand. Shredding the chicken is the most time-consuming step, but it's worth it in the
            end. Serve with sour cream and a side of Spanish rice. Give these babies a try!

            <li>1 ¼ cups sour cream</li>
            <li>1 (10.5 ounce) can condensed cream of chicken soup</li>

            <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
            <li>1 small onion, chopped</li>
            <li>1 cup water</li>
            <li>1 bunch green onions, chopped, divided</li>
            <li>1 (4 ounce) can chopped green chiles, drained</li>
            <li>1 (1.25 ounce) package mild taco seasoning mix</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon lime juice</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon onion powder</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>5 (12 inch) flour tortillas</li>
            <li>3 cups shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>1 (10 ounce) can enchilada sauce</li>
            <li>1 (6 ounce) can sliced black olives, drained</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Place chicken into a large pot and add water to cover. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce the
                heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until chicken is no longer pink and the juices run clear, about 10
                minutes.<br></p></li>
            <li><p>Remove from the pot and let sit until cool enough to handle, 5 to 10 minutes. Shred chicken with two
                forks.<br></p></li>
            <li><p>Combine sour cream, condensed soup, and chili powder in a saucepan. Bring to a simmer, stirring
                occasionally, then turn off the heat and cover to keep warm.<br></p></li>
            <li><p>At the same time, melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add onion; cook and stir until translucent,
                about 5 minutes. Add shredded chicken, water, 1/2 of the green onions, green chiles, and taco seasoning;
                simmer for 10 minutes. Stir in lime juice, onion powder, and garlic powder; simmer for 10 more minutes.<br></p>
            </li>
            <li><p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).<br></p></li>
            <li><p>Stir 1 cup soup mixture into the skillet with the chicken. Spread remaining soup mixture over the bottom
                of a 9x13-inch baking dish.<br></p></li>
            <li><p>Fill each tortilla with 1/5 of the chicken mixture and about 5 tablespoons Cheddar cheese.<br></p></li>
            <li><p>Roll tortillas around filling and place enchiladas, seam-side down, into the baking dish. Pour enchilada
                sauce over top and sprinkle with remaining Cheddar, remaining green onions, and olives.<br></p></li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until filling is heated through and cheese is melted and bubbling, about 25
                minutes.</li>

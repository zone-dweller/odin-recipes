            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                The secret to these awesome chicken enchiladas is in the seasonings! I whipped these up on my own using
                ingredients I had on hand. Shredding the chicken is the most time-consuming step, but it's worth it in
                the
                end. Serve with sour cream and a side of Spanish rice. Give these babies a try!

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>Place chicken into a large pot and add water to cover. Bring to a boil over high heat, then
                        reduce the
                        heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until chicken is no longer pink and the juices run clear,
                        about 10
                        minutes.<br></p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Remove from the pot and let sit until cool enough to handle, 5 to 10 minutes. Shred chicken with
                        two
                        forks.<br></p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Combine sour cream, condensed soup, and chili powder in a saucepan. Bring to a simmer, stirring
                        occasionally, then turn off the heat and cover to keep warm.<br></p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>At the same time, melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add onion; cook and stir until
                        translucent,
                        about 5 minutes. Add shredded chicken, water, 1/2 of the green onions, green chiles, and taco
                        seasoning;
                        simmer for 10 minutes. Stir in lime juice, onion powder, and garlic powder; simmer for 10 more
                        minutes.<br></p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).<br></p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Stir 1 cup soup mixture into the skillet with the chicken. Spread remaining soup mixture over the
                        bottom
                        of a 9x13-inch baking dish.<br></p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Fill each tortilla with 1/5 of the chicken mixture and about 5 tablespoons Cheddar cheese.<br>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Roll tortillas around filling and place enchiladas, seam-side down, into the baking dish. Pour
                        enchilada
                        sauce over top and sprinkle with remaining Cheddar, remaining green onions, and olives.<br></p>
                </li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until filling is heated through and cheese is melted and bubbling, about
                    25
                    minutes.</li>
